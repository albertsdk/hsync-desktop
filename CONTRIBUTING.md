# Contributing to hsync-desktop

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers the development
workflow for the HSYNC desktop GUI (PySide6).

## Prerequisites

- Python `>=3.12,<3.15` (lint/CI target: **3.13**)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- A checkout of [`hsync-common`](../hsync-common) as a **sibling directory**
  (declared as a Poetry path dependency)

## Setup

```bash
poetry install
```

## Running

```bash
poetry run hsync-desktop
```

## Building the Binary

```bash
./compile.sh    # build standalone binary (PyInstaller)
```

## Code Style

This project uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and
formatting (line length 100, target `py313`), enforced via pre-commit hooks.

```bash
poetry run ruff check --fix .
poetry run ruff format .
```

## Pre-commit Workflow

Pre-commit hooks run ruff (and an end-of-file fixer) on commit. When a hook
auto-fixes files, the commit aborts because files changed — **this is expected,
not a failure**. Re-stage and commit again:

```bash
poetry run ruff check --fix .
poetry run ruff format .
git add -A
git commit -m "type(scope): message"
# if hooks modified files and the commit aborted, re-stage and retry:
git add -A
git commit -m "type(scope): message"
```

## Tests & Type Checking

```bash
poetry run pytest      # GUI tests use pytest-qt
poetry run mypy .
```

## Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`type(scope): summary` (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, …).

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused and covered by tests.
- Ensure `ruff`, `pytest` and `mypy` pass locally before opening a PR.
